# Lottery System: An Event Attendance Platform.

This is a lottery system Android Mobile Application where users can choose to be an organizer or an entrant. As an organizer, the user can create their facility and host events. When an event is submitted, a QR is automatically created for organizers to share their event, allowing entrants to easily view details and sign up for the event's waitlist. Entrants can scan QR codes, view their past, current, and future events, and sign up for new events they are interested in.

This application uses Firestore for data storage and security. It also uses JUnit and Mockito for in-depth testing so users can confidently use the platform as they wish.
